# PopulationDensityData

Incubating API Repository to evolve and maintain the definitions and documentation of PopulationDensityData Service API(s) within the Sub Project [Population Density Data](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/LwAwC) 

* API Repository [wiki page](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/3DXe)

## Scope
* Service APIs for “Population Density Data” (see APIBacklog.md)  
* It provides the API consumer with the ability to:  
  * The service enables developers with the capability to get dynamic population density data in a specific area for a specified date&time, considering anonymized information of the network connected devices in the requested area at the flight time.
    * Use Case (1): Providing BVLOS flight the data to meet SORA 2.5 requirements in terms of intrinsic Ground Risk Class (iGRC).
    * Use Case (2): Providing data to identify if the ground risk class for a given drone flight is acceptable for the time of the flight, or an alternative time should be considered to lower the risk.
  * Service Inputs: Area of the interest. Date & time range.
  * Service Outputs: maximum, average and minimum population density value for the given area, and interval corresponding to the valid range of that value. (space and time maps).
  * NOTE: The scope of these APIs should be limited (at least at a first stage) to 4G and 5G.  
* Describe, develop, document and test the APIs (with 1-2 Telcos)  
* Started: December 2023
* Incubating stage since: June 2025
