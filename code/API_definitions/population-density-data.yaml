    Population Density Data API exposes population density estimations
    for a specified area for a specified time interval.

    # Introduction

    With the Population Density Data API the customer can retrieve population density estimations
    for a specific area at the current or a specified period of time. The estimation considers historical
    anonymized information of the network connected devices in the requested
    area. * Note that the data provided are estimations of population, based on past or future predicted data, for both past or future time ranges. 



    This functionality can be used for multiple use
    cases, some of the possible use cases for this API are:


    - Supporting BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) flights with the
    information needed to meet SORA 2.5 (Specific Operation Risk Assessment)
    requirements in terms of intrinsic Ground Risk Class (iGRC).
    More information in [Specific Operations Risk Assessment](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)

    - Providing information to identify if the ground risk class for
    a given drone flight path is acceptable for the time of the flight, or an
    alternative time should be considered to lower the risk.

    - Sustainable Urban Planning.

    - Environmental monitoring at mass events, such as concerts or festivals.


    The list above is just a few examples, the API can be used for other use cases as well.


    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Population Density**: refers to the number of people in a given area divided by the total size of the area.

    * **Notification URL and token**: Developers may provide a callback URL (`sink`) for receiving an async response.
    This is an optional parameter. If `sink` is included, it is RECOMMENDED for the client to provide as well the `sinkCredential`
    property to protect the notification endpoint. In the current version,`sinkCredential.credentialType` MUST be set to `ACCESSTOKEN` if provided.
    When an asynchronous response is requested, the 202 response of the API will include an `operationId` property. This `operationId` property will
    also be sent in the callback notification. The purpose of the `operationId` is to correlate an asynchronous response with its corresponding request.

    # API Functionality

    Once a developer specifies (1) the area as a polygon shape, (2) a precision level and (3) time interval
    in which they want to obtain the population density, the API returns a data
    set consisting of a sequence of time ranges, with each time range containing the
    input polygon subdivided into equal-sized grid cells.


    For each of the equal-sized cells of the grid, an estimated population density is
    reported for each time slot within the range, this includes: estimated population density people/km2, and a range for this estimation - [minimum, maximum]
    (exact definitions of minimum and maximum are estimation algorithm specific).


    These values are calculated based on historical data, prediction models, and population estimation models. The requested interval must either be completely in the future or in the past.


    The polygon specifying an area of interest must comply with certain restrictions,
    which must be previously validated by the developer:

    - The polygon may not exceed a certain area.

    - The polygon may not contain more than 15 vertexes.

    - The polygon must be associated with a location where the MNO provides
    mobile connectivity services. If a polygon is located entirely outside the
    supported area, an empty array is returned.


    The standard behaviour of the API is synchronous, although for large
    area requests the API may behave asynchronously. An API invoker can enforce
    asynchronous behaviour by providing a callback URL (`sink`)
    is in the request, in this case the API sends a callback
    to the callback URL provided with the result of the request. If `sink` is
    included, it is RECOMMENDED for the client to provide as well the `sinkCredential`
    property to protect the notification endpoint. In the current version,`sinkCredential.credentialType`
    MUST be set to `ACCESSTOKEN` if provided.


    For requests with a combination of `area`, `precision`, `startTime` and `endTime`
    properties involving an amount of processing that cannot be processed synchronously,
    the API returns the error response `POPULATION_DENSITY_DATA.UNSUPPORTED_SYNC_RESPONSE`.


    For requests with a combination of `area`, `precision`, `startTime` and `endTime`
    properties too big for both synchronous and asynchronous processing, the API
    returns the error response `POPULATION_DENSITY_DATA.UNSUPPPORTED_REQUEST`.

    If an error happens during the asynchronous processing of the request. The API callback
    will have property `status` with value `OPERATION_NOT_COMPLETED` as an error cannot be returned in the callback.
    The callback will also include the `statusInfo` property to add extra information about the error.

    **NOTE**: In order to ensure anonymized information, if the data relating to
    a grid cell in the required time interval is not sufficient to be exposed due
    to [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity), no such data is
    returned by the API and the value of the dataType property is `LOW_DENSITY`.

    # Resources and Operations overview

    The API provides one endpoint that accepts POST requests for retrieving population
    density information in the specified area.

    # Authorization and Authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how a client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the Profile.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

    Population Density Data API ensures the usage of anonymized information and do not treat personal data neither as input nor output.
    Therefore, the access to Population Density Data API is defined as Client Credentials - 2-legged. Please refer to Identify and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the latest detailed specification of this authentication/authorization flow.
