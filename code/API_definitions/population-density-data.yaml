  title: Population Density Data
  description: >-
    Allows developers with the capability to get population density estimations
    for a specific area at a future period of time, considering historical
    anonymized information of the network connected devices in the requested
    area.

    # Introduction

    This API allows estimates of population density to be obtained for a specific
    area in a future time period. This functionality can be used for multiple use
    cases, some of the possible use cases for this API are shown below.


    - Providing BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) flights with the
    information to meet SORA 2.5 (Specific Operation Risk Assessment)
    requirements in terms of intrinsic Ground Risk Class (iGRC).
    More information in [Specific Operations Risk Assessment](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)

    - Providing information to identify if the ground risk class for
    a given drone flight path is acceptable for the time of the flight, or an
    alternative time should be considered to lower the risk.

    - Sustainable Urban Planning. Enabling urban planners to specify the area of
    interest and a future time period.

    - Environmental monitoring at mass events, such as concerts or festivals.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Population Density**: refers to the number of people in a concrete area.

    # API Functionality

    This API can be used for use cases that are not specified in this description,
    we simply wanted to provide examples of possible use cases.


    Once a developer specifies: (1) the area as a polygon shape,(2) a precision level and (3) time interval
    in which they want to obtain the population density, the API will return a data
    set consisting of a sequence of time ranges each time range containing the
    input polygon subdivided into equal sized cells.


    In each of the equal sized cells of the grid, an estimated population density will be
    reported for each time slot within the range, this includes: estimated population density people/km2, and a range for this estimation - [minimum, maximum]
    (exact definitions of minimum and maximum are estimation algorithm specific).


    These KPIs per geographic unit are an estimate relative to the future and
    based on calculations with historical data and/or prediction models trained
    on such data.  The polygon provided must comply with certain restrictions,
    which must be previously validated by the developer:

    - The polygon will not be able to exceed a certain area.

    - The polygon cannot have an arbitrary complexity (unlimited number of
    sides, complex shapes, etc.).

    - The polygon must be associated with a location where the telco provides
    mobile connectivity services. If a polygon is located entirely outside the
    supported area, an empty array will be returned.
    
    
    The standard behaviour of the API will be synchronous, although for large
    area requests the API may behave asynchronously. In case the `webhook` property
    is in the request, the API behaviour will be asynchronous by sending a callback
    to the `notificationUrl` provided with the result of the request.


    For requests with a combination of `area`, `precision`, `startDate` and `endDate`
    properties involving an amount of processing that cannot be done synchronously,
    the API will return the error response `POPULATION_DENSITY_DATA.UNSUPPORTED_SYNC_RESPONSE`.

    For requests with a combination of `area`, `precision`, `startDate` and `endDate`
    properties too big for both synchronous and asynchronous behaviour, the API will
    return the error response `POPULATION_DENSITY_DATA.UNSUPPPORTED_REQUEST`.

    **NOTE**: In order to ensure anonymized information, if the data relating to
    the cell in the required time interval is not sufficient to be displayed due
    to [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity), no such data will
    be returned and the value of the dataType property will be `LOW_DENSITY`.

    # Resources and Operations overview

    The API provides one endpoint that accepts POST requests for retrieving population
    density information in the specified area.

    # Authorization and Authentication
    
    CAMARA guidelines defines a set of authorization flows which can grant API clients access
    to the API functionality, as outlined in the document [CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md).
    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during
    onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator
    exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API,
    while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.
    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API,
    and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out,
    the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains
    in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the 
    principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

    Population Density Data API ensures the usage of anonymized information and do not treat
    personal data neither as input nor output. 
    Therefore, the access to Population Density Data API is defined as 
    Client Credentials - 2-legged as described in [CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md - Client Credentials](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md#client-credentials)
